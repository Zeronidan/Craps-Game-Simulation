A java program that simulates the game of Craps.  Collaborated with Diana Sandil
in my ICS 45J Java class at UCI.

- Lab2.java contains the main method to start the simulation of the game
- CrapsGame.java contains all the information for a single craps game
- CrapsMetricsMonitor.java contains all the game statistics of a single simulation
- CrapsSimulation.java keeps track of all the information of the game: game objects 
(CrapsGame and CrapsMetricsMonitor) and player variables
